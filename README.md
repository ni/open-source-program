# LabVIEW Open-Source Framework

> 🧪 This repository implements the first governed module in the [NI Open-Source Program](https://github.com/ni/open-source).  
> All participation, scoring, and recognition in this repo follow [structured governance rules](https://github.com/ni/open-source/tree/main/docs/governance).

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository serves as a reusable foundation for open-source LabVIEW modules that meet the following goals:

- Accelerate adoption of NI technologies in real-world applications
- Enable contributions from both NI and external users
- Support certification scoring, test harnesses, and SteerCo participation
- Align with audit-ready contributor recognition

---

## 📐 Governance and Structure

This repository is governed by the [NI Open-Source Governance Framework](https://github.com/ni/open-source), which defines:

- Role authority (Program Manager, SteerCo, Core Team)
- Contributor recognition (badges, scoring, certification points)
- GitHub activity requirements (PR templates, test reports)
- Escalation and override protocols

| Feature                      | Enforced? | Notes |
|------------------------------|-----------|-------|
| Manual Test Reports Required | ✅        | For scoring + certification eligibility |
| PR Template Enforcement      | ✅        | Required for contribution recognition |
| Role-Based Scoring           | ✅        | SteerCo input required for prioritization |
| Escalation Path Available    | ✅        | Use `governance-appeal` label or GitHub Discussions |

## 🛡️ Architecture & Trust Model

This repo inherits its structure and recognition logic from the upstream governance program.

> ✅ The canonical governance source is [ni/open-source](https://github.com/ni/open-source)  
> ✅ All scoring, recognition, and role definitions live there  
> ✅ This design allows the framework to remain stable even if:
> - NI launches a new program
> - This repo is forked or evolves
> - Contributors shift across orgs

This separation ensures contributor trust, auditability, and long-term governance continuity.
