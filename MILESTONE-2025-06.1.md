# MILESTONE-2025-06.1 — Metadata-Based Maintainer Automation

> 🛰️ Automates badge eligibility detection for Maintainers using GitHub metadata (labels, templates, and PR structure).

---

## 📅 Date Started
2025-05-25

---

## 🎯 Objective

Introduce the first layer of automation to the NI Open-Source Governance Framework, enabling GitHub Actions to detect and flag contributors eligible for the Maintainer badge.

This milestone isolates **metadata logic** from full role lifecycle to allow faster rollout, validation, and audit integration.
