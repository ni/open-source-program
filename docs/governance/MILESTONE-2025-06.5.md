# MILESTONE-2025-06.5 — Signal Observation Activation

> 🎯 This milestone activates passive observation of recognition signals across all onboarded participant repositories in the NI Open Source Program.

---

## 🔍 Observed Signal Types

- GitHub Issues and PRs using `contributor-recognition.md`
- Labels such as `recognition-missing`, `opt-in`, `public-log`
- Form submissions referencing contributor metadata
- Comments containing `#manual-override` or badge nominations

---

## 🔒 Enforcement

- No scoring, badge issuance, or automation may occur under this milestone
- Signal ingestion is passive and milestone-traceable only
- Contributors must opt in via templates or form submissions

---

## 🧠 GPT Threads Allowed to Observe

- Recognition GPT (`v2025.07`–future)
- System GPT (for milestone auditing)
- Certification Layer GPT (already retired, no new ingestion)

---

## 🧩 Scope

This milestone applies to:
- `ni/labview-icon-editor`
- `ni/actor-framework`
- Future onboarding participants listed in `REPO-ONBOARDING-INDEX.md`

---

## 🧾 GPT Output Notes

Any GPT that ingests a recognition signal must:
- Log its action in a milestone-bound output file (e.g. `recognition-feed.yml`)
- Respect `AUTOMATION-MODE.md` freeze
