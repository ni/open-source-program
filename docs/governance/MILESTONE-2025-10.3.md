# MILESTONE-2025-10.3 â€” Contributor Metadata Sync Proposal

> ðŸ”„ This milestone proposes a method for safely syncing contributor metadata from the NI Open Source Program into downstream systems and GPTs.

---

## âœ… Sync Targets

| System | Allowed Data |
|--------|--------------|
| GitHub Dashboards | Public contributor feeds (`recognition-feed.yml`, `recertification-feed.yml`) |
| Docs Sites / READMEs | GitHub handle, opt-in status, milestone links |
| GPT Dashboards | Public data only, milestone-locked |
| Internal Tools | SharePoint exports, CLA-validated records |

## ðŸ”’ Sync Enforcement Rules

- No system may auto-sync unless authorized by milestone (`v2025.11+`)
- All metadata must be:
  - Milestone-bound
  - Contributor opt-in
  - Read-only unless overridden

---

## ðŸ§¾ Metadata Includes

- GitHub handle
- Recognition tags (if surfaced)
- Point value (if milestone-approved)
- Opt-in and validation status
- Source repo + PR reference
