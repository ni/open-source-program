# ðŸ“˜ Repositories Under NI Open-Source Governance

This document tracks all repositories currently governed by the NI Open-Source Program as of `v2025.99`.

---

## ðŸ§­ Canonical Governance Repositories

These define the rules, milestones, and architectural inheritance:

| Repository | Role | Status |
|------------|------|--------|
| [ni/open-source-program](https://github.com/ni/open-source-program) | Root governance authority | âœ… Active |
| [ni/labview-open-source-program](https://github.com/ni/labview-open-source-program) | LabVIEW-specific governance branch | âœ… Active |

---

## ðŸ§ª Governed Execution Repositories

These participate in governance and must align with milestone behavior, CLA roles, and contributor rules.

| Repository | Governance State | Notes |
|------------|------------------|-------|
| [ni/labview-icon-editor](https://github.com/ni/labview-icon-editor) | ðŸŸ¢ Active | CLA in use, contributors recognized, certification logic live |
| [ni/actor-framework](https://github.com/ni/actor-framework) | ðŸŸ¡ Pre-Evaluation | SteerCo identified; governance files pending drop |

---

## ðŸ“Œ Migration Notes

- Each governed repo will progressively adopt the `PROGRAM-GUIDE.md`, `PRIORITY-SCORE.md`, and other governance documents
- CLA metadata, milestone tags, and contributor status will become visible in GitHub actions or manual exports
