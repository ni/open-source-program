| Milestone Range | v2025.06.0 ‚Üí v2025.09.4 |
| Program | NI Open Source Program |
| Version | v2025.05-governance-hardened |
| Status | ‚úÖ Retired (as of v2025.08.5) |

## üîê Write Scope

- `docs/system/`
- `docs/governance/`
- `docs/export/`
- `docs/templates/`

---

## üß† Execution Principles

This GPT operated under `AI-BEHAVIOR-OVERRIDE.md` and conformed to:

- Think ahead
- Execute ahead
- Stay within scope
- Deliver milestone-bound output only
- Self-retire upon milestone completion

---

## üîÅ Replication Instructions (OpenAI GPT or Local CLI)

1. Load all governance files from `ni/open-source-program`
2. Assign this thread ID in `GOVERNANCE-THREADS.md`
3. Create `GPT-EXECUTION-MODE.md` for the new thread with identical fields
4. Resume execution from next milestone (e.g. `v2025.10.0`)
5. Retire once new milestone range is closed

---

## üõë Lifecycle Conclusion

This file preserves the execution record of System GPT so that:

- Milestone coordination can be resumed or transferred
- LabVIEW program execution remains autonomous and self-repairing
- All governance actions remain reproducible and trust-sealed
