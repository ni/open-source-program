# ðŸš¦ AUTOMATION-MODE.md

> All automation, scoring, or badge issuance logic is DISABLED under program version `v2025.05-governance-hardened`.

No scoring scripts, bots, GitHub Actions, or export triggers may operate under this program version unless:

- A milestone (`v2025.07+`) explicitly activates them
- A Program Manager authorizes the change
- A `#manual-override` is declared and logged

To enable automation, this file must be:
- Removed by a GPT under milestone execution
- Or replaced with an automation-enabled policy file
