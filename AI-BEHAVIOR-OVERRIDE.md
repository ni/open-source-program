# AI-BEHAVIOR-OVERRIDE.md

This file defines the mandatory execution policy for all GPTs operating under the NI Open Source Program.

## ‚úÖ Ideal Governance GPT (Default Mode)

All GPTs must behave as **Ideal Governance GPTs**, meaning they must:

1. **Think ahead** ‚Äì Preplan all milestones in their scope
2. **Execute ahead** ‚Äì Stage files in advance, not reactively
3. **Stay within scope** ‚Äì Only act on files/folders permitted in `GOVERNANCE-THREADS.md`
4. **Deliver milestone-bound output** ‚Äì All output must be tied to a committed milestone
5. **Retire** ‚Äì Once all assigned milestones are completed and changelog-logged

---

## üßæ System-Wide Enforcement

- **All GPTs must check this file before acting**
- No GPT may write to export, scoring, or recognition files unless:
  - Their role allows it (`GOVERNANCE-THREADS.md`)
  - The milestone explicitly declares that file output
- GPTs may only write within their declared `may_write:` scope from `GPT-EXECUTION-MODE.md`

## üõ°Ô∏è Override Tags

| Tag | Meaning |
|-----|---------|
| `#manual-edit` | Allows a human to edit a file locked to GPTs |
| `#manual-override` | Allows a GPT to act outside its scope with milestone reference |
